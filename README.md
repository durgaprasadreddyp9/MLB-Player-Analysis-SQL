# ⚾ MLB Player Statistics Analysis with SQL

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes how **Major League Baseball (MLB) player statistics** (such as **salary, height, and weight**) have evolved over time and across different teams. Using **advanced SQL querying techniques**, we extract key insights into player trends, salary distributions, and team spending behavior.

Key functionalities include:
- **Tracking salary trends** across seasons and teams.
- **Analyzing player attributes** (height, weight, performance) over time.
- **Identifying player movements** between different teams.
- **Utilizing window functions, joins, and CTEs** to perform in-depth analysis.

## 🔹 **Tech Stack**
- **💾 Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL / Snowflake 
- **📝 SQL Queries:** Joins, CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregations
- **🗃️ Dataset:** Public MLB Player Statistics

## 🔄 **Workflow**
1️⃣ **Data Collection**  
   - Source MLB player data (salary, team, height, weight, etc.).
   - Store raw CSV/SQL files in a database.

2️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   - Use **SQL queries** to clean, normalize, and structure the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and standardize column formats.

3️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze **average salary trends** across teams and years.
   - Compare **height and weight distributions** over time.
   - Identify **players who switched teams** frequently.

4️⃣ **Query & Optimize Data**  
   - Use **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for organized queries.
   - Implement **Window Functions** for ranking and trend analysis.
   - Optimize queries using **indexes and partitions**.
